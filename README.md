# piglatinpy
_Pig Latin_ is a language game, in which English words are altered, according to some rules, to obtain their _Pig Latin_ translation. The _piglatinpy_ program allows translating words from English to _Pig Latin_.

## Instructions for You
* You are asked to develop _piglatinpy_ by following TDD.
* You DO NOT need to develop a GUI.
* While developing _piglatinpy_, you can consult Python APIs on the internet. However, you CANNOT use the internet to interact with others or AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT).
* The _piglatinpy_ requirements are divided into a set of USER STORIES, which serve as a to-do list (see the _Issues_ session).
* You should be able to incrementally develop PLT without an upfront comprehension of all the _piglatinpy_ requirements. DO NOT read ahead, and handle the requirements (i.e., specified in the user stories) one at a time in the provided order. Develop _piglatinpy_ by starting from the first storyâ€™s requirement. When a story is IMPLEMENTED, move on to the NEXT one. A story is implemented when you are confident that your program correctly implements the functionality stipulated by the story's requirement. This implies that all your test cases for that story and all the test cases for the previous stories pass. You may need to review your program as you progress toward more advanced requirements.
* Each time you end a TDD phase, COMMIT.
* If you need to handle error situations (including situations unspecified by the user stories), throw a _PigLatinError_.
